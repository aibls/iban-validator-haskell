IBAN Validator in Haskell
-------------------------

This small Haskell project implements IBAN validation according to the formal IBAN rules.

Features:
- block validation
- country code validation
- IBAN length verification
- character filtering and resolving (A=10...Z=35)
- conversion to integer and mod 97 check

This was built as part of my Functional Programming course at ELTE.
